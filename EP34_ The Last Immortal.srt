Why are you drinking alone without me?

36
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,510
I'm fine.
I'm just thinking about something.

37
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,150
It's about Hong Yi, isn't it?

38
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,830
I know you've been with him
for a thousand years in this cottage.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,620
You're more than friends.

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,670
But the pear blossoms only remind him of you,

41
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,580
not me.

42
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,590
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:53,710
I'm only getting married to him
to find the devil cultivator.

44
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,860
And once we find him,

45
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,750
my marriage to him will...

46
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,590
I know.

47
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,900
But he's so happy even if your marriage
is fake.

48
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:08,460
Yan Shuang, you know

49
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,830
Hong Yi has always been a friend to me.

50
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,360
And I think his feelings for you are...

51
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,340
Don't be so tense, dummy.

52
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,300
It's not your fault.

53
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,990
It's just wishful thinking for him
and me alike.

54
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,990
It's not up to us

55
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,830
whom we like or not.

56
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,900
But it doesn't matter anymore.

57
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,710
I'm ready to let him go.

58
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,430
If you've really let go,
why are you drinking here?

59
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,860
It's kind of a farewell ceremony.

60
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,390
You know I used to be playful.

61
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,580
I couldn't let go of Hong Yi,

62
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,060
or perform my duty.

63
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,950
The Eagle Clan is declining
and the devils are on the move.

64
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,220
I must go back and perform my duty.

65
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,270
I'm ready to return and take over
the throne of the Eagle Clan.

66
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,710
As for all the petty love affairs,

67
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,190
it's no longer worth the Queen's while
to think about it.

68
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,110
Are you serious?

69
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,630
Of course I am.

70
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,950
You are now the Phoenix Queen.

71
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,870
Hong Yi has also become the Demon King.

72
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,220
We all do our jobs,

73
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,750
taking up the slack in the clan.

74
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,420
How can I still be as unmotivated
as I was before?

75
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,070
Don't worry, after I become
the Eagle Queen,

76
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,460
I'm gonna be good and do great things.

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,840
Drink with me.

78
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,540
Your Majesty is going to marry
the Phoenix Queen?

79
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,950
It's a ploy to find out the devil spy.

80
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,710
It's confidential. I'd like to ask you
to personally make the arrangements.

81
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,340
Don't let anyone know.

82
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,980
You've been with Yin
for a thousand years.

83
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,070
Though the original purpose
is to find out the devil spy,

84
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,460
you've gotten what you wanted.

85
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,710
You don't look as happy
as I thought you were.

86
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,340
You won't believe what I'm about to say.

87
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,100
All I could think about before

88
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:52,660
was to catch the culprit at the wedding
while the god light shines

89
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,270
and avenge my aunt and Yin.

90
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,540
I never thought about getting
what I wanted.

91
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,870
Yin and Feng Yin are different to me
after all.

92
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,070
Yin is cute and passionate.
Feng Yin is rational and calm.

93
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,630
She's too sensible to even get close to.

94
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,020
She has become Feng Yin,

95
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,980
the Queen of the Phoenix Clan,
admired by many.

96
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,630
You're not used to it, right?

97
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,340
I was surely happy that she returned

98
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,830
and became the Phoenix Queen.

99
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,270
It's just because I've wronged Yin.

100
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,560
I've always kept her in my heart.

101
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,150
Now I see she's doing well.

102
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:38,460
I don't think there's anything
to worry about.

103
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,000
Of course.

104
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,750
It's nice to see Yuan Qi sulking.

105
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,270
I'll help you prepare for the wedding.

106
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,520
Shu,

107
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,540
what brings you back to Bainiao Island
all of a sudden?

108
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:11,190
Father, do you know that Feng Ming was
killed by a devil cultivator last night?

109
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,270
What? Who is the murderer?

110
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,510
I wanted to ask you this yesterday
in the hall.

111
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,780
When Lan Feng was killed,

112
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:24,870
there was a black shadow behind him.
Do you know who that was?

113
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,540
How could I know?

114
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,870
You don't suspect me, do you?

115
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,510
A devil cultivator who also has access
to both the Heavenly Palace and Prison.

116
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,750
I have to rule out every suspect.

117
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,710
I can't believe you doubted
your own father.

118
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,020
I just want to know the truth.

119
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,640
Alright.

120
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,900
I'll show you the truth.

121
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:52,980
(Open to Good Advice)

122
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,900
See for yourself.

123
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,440
Lan Feng.

124
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,580
Lan Feng shows signs of life.

125
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,390
Do the devils really have a way
to bring Lan Feng back to life?

126
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,980
Definitely.

127
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,840
Shu,

128
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,900
Lan Feng is my son-in-law.

129
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,270
For the sake of your happiness,
how could I harm him?

130
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,660
I've been saving him
for a thousand years.

131
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:30,390
If I were the murderer, how would I
want him to come back to life?

132
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:34,820
I practiced devil magic to save
myself and others.

133
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,350
What's wrong with that?

134
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:40,990
Father, I'm just afraid that
you're involved in this.

135
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,540
I'm sorry, Father.

136
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,160
Never mind.

137
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,300
Now, amid internal and external threats,

138
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:55,540
you and I must work together
to get through this.

139
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:10,350
I've been thinking. Feng Yin wasn't there
when it all happened a thousand years ago.

140
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,230
Why would she help Qing Yi and Yin
from Daze Mountain?

141
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,820
I guess she's using them against me.

142
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:24,060
But if other immortals were involved
in Lan Feng's death,

143
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,060
I want to get them too.

144
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:29,630
Since Yuan Qi wants to find out
what happened back then, I'll help him.

145
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,420
I had some trouble with him
the other day.

146
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,540
I can get closer to
and reconcile with him

147
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,230
in this investigation.

148
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,780
By the way, I can find out

149
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,780
what else Feng Yin is up to.

150
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,630
Your Godship,

151
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,900
I found this from the sealed files
of the Heavenly Palace.

152
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,660
You may find the investigation file useful.

153
00:09:59,150 --> 00:09:59,990
Thank you.

154
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,960
You're welcome.

155
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:05,060
If you need anything, please let me know.

156
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,510
I'll do my best to help.

157
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,630
You're just in time. I do have
something to ask you.

158
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,590
When Emperor Lan Feng died,

159
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,390
many fairy maids of the Heavenly Palace
were relegated for their mistakes,

160
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,420
especially the ones on duty
at Lingyu Hall.

161
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,650
But whatever they did wrong
isn't recorded,

162
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,870
not even their whereabouts. Why?

163
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,940
The Wind Lord helped to investigate.

164
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,870
There was indeed a lot of chaos in
the Immortal Realm in those days.

165
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,940
They made frequent mistakes due to this.

166
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,630
Including your maid Hongque?

167
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,380
She was guarding Emperor Lan Feng's
ice coffin.

168
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:45,420
But the coffin was damaged
due to her negligence.

169
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,940
My father found it in time. Otherwise,
Lan Feng's remains would be...

170
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,180
She deserved to be punished by being
removed of her immortal bones

171
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,240
and sent down to the Mortal Realm
forever.

172
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,280
Your Godship.

173
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,800
Your Godship,

174
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,270
a message has come from the Phoenix Clan.

175
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,110
It says

176
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,620
the Phoenix Queen and the Demon King
are getting married.

177
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,390
Getting married?

178
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,820
Feng Yin and Hong Yi are to be married
in seven days.

179
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,000
The Three Lower Realms
have been notified.

180
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,660
This is the invitation they gave you.

181
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,140
(The Phoenix Queen
and the Demon King's Wedding)

182
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,020
A thousand years ago, on the day
Feng Yin was born,

183
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,150
Fox Queen Hong Ruo brought Hong Yi
to Wutong Island to propose marriage.

184
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,390
And Feng Yin became close to Hong Yi
soon after her return.

185
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,900
If you think about it,
this marriage isn't so surprising.

186
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:37,110
A Demon King and a Phoenix Queen
are a perfect match.

187
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,100
(Invitation)

188
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,100
Your Godship, are you all right?

189
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,960
Your Godship.

190
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,140
(Wedding Plan
Wedding at the Heavenly Square)

191
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,510
All right, that's it.

192
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,510
Inform the Three Realms of my betrothal
to the Demon King.

193
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,050
- Yes.
- Feng Yin.

194
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:03,990
Your Godship.

195
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,390
Why would you marry Hong Yi?

196
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,700
Since you're here,
let's talk about some business.

197
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,750
What business?

198
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,110
That's what I came to ask.

199
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:18,950
Answer me.

200
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,540
I don't need to discuss whom I marry

201
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,700
with you, do I?

202
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,780
But you and Jiu are just friends, aren't you?

203
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,150
We are.

204
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:40,390
But we've got time to develop love.

205
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,470
Yin.

206
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,180
Don't marry someone else.

207
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,820
I'm not Yin.

208
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,290
- Let go.
- No.

209
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,350
I've waited so long for your return.
I don't want to let go.

210
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,020
I'm afraid you've forgotten
what you said.

211
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:11,540
You said a Water Divine Beast's life
is only a brief moment in yours.

212
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,870
Though Yin and I are fellow disciples
in the same sect,

213
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,990
she's just a passerby in my life.

214
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,180
All the things about Jin are just a flash
in the pan with no memory left.

215
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,750
Now I am Feng Yin,

216
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:31,870
a demigod.
Is that why you come back to me?

217
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,440
It's not like that.

218
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,180
I said those words because...

219
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,710
Because what?

220
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,230
Anyway, it was my fault.

221
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,510
Whether it was or not,

222
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,710
it's not important.

223
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,960
(Celebrate the peace of the immortals
and the demons)

224
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,660
Why are you worried, Father?

225
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,380
When Feng Yin marries Hong Yi,

226
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,630
she and Yuan Qi will be impossible.

227
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,150
Isn't this a good thing for us?

228
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,420
It's not that simple.

229
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,470
The Phoenix Queen is getting married soon
after she proposed to reopen the case.

230
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:01,060
The wedding must have something
to do with the case.

231
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:07,990
Shu, I'm afraid this will not only
affect your bid for Heavenly Empress,

232
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,180
but also delay Lan Feng's resurrection.

233
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,280
No,

234
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,420
there must be no mistake
about the two plans.

235
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,750
We must find out what they're up to.

236
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:26,060
(I don't believe there's no inside story
to this marriage.)

237
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,750
(I'm going to find out what's going on
with these two.)

238
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,740
His Lordship Lin Mo says Your Majesty
need to choose the robe for the wedding.

239
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,950
Please select the gifts for the wedding.

240
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:07,230
During the wedding, you and
the Phoenix Queen need to exchange gifts.

241
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,780
Your Majesty will decide it to show
your sincerity.

242
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,590
Did you see Yan Shuang?

243
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,180
Why didn't she come?

244
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,200
Your Majesty.

245
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:26,860
Her Highness said
she was busy and couldn't come.

246
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,590
Didn't you tell her it was urgent?

247
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,990
I need her help
with the wedding arrangement.

248
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,510
I did.

249
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:40,150
I stood her up once,
and she's done with me.

250
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:42,870
You may go.

251
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,110
Your Majesty.

252
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,900
His Lordship said
you should make early decisions

253
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,940
before late.

254
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,300
Alright, got it.

255
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,390
Yes.

256
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,910
Your Highness, the Demon King
is waiting outside.

257
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,260
Tell him I'm busy.

258
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,480
Yes.

259
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,350
Are you done?

260
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,560
So are you free?

261
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,910
I told you to...

262
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,420
I'm willing to wait.

263
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,630
I kept you waiting last time.

264
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,910
So I made it up to you three times over.
Can we have peace?

265
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:29,660
Look how the flowers have wilted
while I waited for you.

266
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,500
Have something to eat.

267
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,830
You're too devoted
to the official business.

268
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,180
Are you here to eat with me?

269
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:53,670
Come on.

270
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:04,110
You don't know how tiresome it is
to arrange a wedding.

271
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,590
They ask me every day,
"Will this work? Is that alright?"

272
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,110
It's giving me a headache.

273
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,110
So help me out here. Help me choose.

274
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,870
Do it on your own.

275
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,500
I've come to beg for your help.

276
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,190
Are you still my friend?

277
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,110
It depends on you.

278
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,630
I'm still busy. Goodbye.

279
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,420
Yan Shuang, I'll be mad at you.

280
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,110
There's a lot of talk in the Three Realms
about Feng Yin's marriage.

281
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:08,260
Looks like she's serious
about marrying Hong Yi.

282
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,940
Hong Yi. You two seem close, huh?

283
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,790
Can't you tell whose side you're on?

284
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,590
Jiu used to be good to Martial Aunt Yin.

285
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,740
To find her for the past thousand years,

286
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,990
he also planted a pear tree for her
in the Mortal Realm.

287
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,940
Is she really touched by his affection?

288
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,520
Found it.

289
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,630
Are you listening to us or not,
Martial Uncle?

290
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,350
They're getting married for the god
light.

291
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,110
- God light?
- God light?

292
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,940
When immortal and demon demigods
get married, there will be god light.

293
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,350
They're trying to find the devil.

294
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,700
I knew Feng Yin wouldn't
marry Hong Yi for love.

295
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,760
Look at this.

296
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:52,900
Though we know the truth, there's nothing
we can do to stop the wedding.

297
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,250
Yes, Martial Aunt Yin is quite different now.

298
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,790
No one can stop her from doing
what she wants to do.

299
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,390
The gown is ready, Your Majesty.

300
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,840
All right.

301
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,390
You may go.

302
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,040
Yes.

303
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:40,180
(Fengyi Palace)

304
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,110
Feng Yin.

305
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,560
What's on your mind?

306
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,580
Why did you come to Wutong Island again?

307
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,260
I know why you want to get married.

308
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,030
The fake marriage
is to draw god light, right?

309
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,180
You've got a lot of nerve.

310
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,900
The Ancestral God is looking forward
to it.

311
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,260
But all you want is the god light.

312
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,070
You'll be punished.

313
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,630
Don't bother to worry about me.

314
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,310
If only I can find the person,

315
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:37,550
I will take any punishment.

316
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,080
Then why don't you choose me?

317
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:45,070
Marrying me can also get you
the god light, can't it?

318
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,420
(Fengyi Palace)

319
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,630
Don't be ridiculous.

320
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,470
I'm perfectly serious.

321
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,510
I'm the son of True Gods.

322
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:58,390
It'll be easier for me to survive
the punishment.

323
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:03,900
It'd give you the idea that all the women
in the world want to marry you.

324
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,800
I've made up my mind.
Say no more.

325
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,190
Feng Yin.

326
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,350
Yuan Qi.

327
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,920
Don't be a philanderer on Wutong Island.

328
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,020
Untie me.

329
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,310
I simply don't want to.

330
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,220
I didn't mean to harass you.

331
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,390
But it turns out to be a good idea.

332
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,790
You seem to have forgotten that

333
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:33,070
the Fire Phoenix is meant to be the
divine beast of the True God of Chaos.

334
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,260
You should follow my orders.

335
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,500
Now I order you to come back
to Qingchi Palace with me.

336
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,280
What are you doing?

337
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,590
Hey!

338
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:45,460
Yuan Qi.

339
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,280
Your Godship.

340
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,030
What's wrong with Her Majesty?

341
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,980
Feng Yin has offended me.

342
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,700
I'm taking her back to Qingchi Palace
to punish her.

343
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:54,950
- Punish?
- Put me down.

344
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,700
- Your Godship, don't.
- Yuan Qi.

345
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,420
Look how jealous he is.

346
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,220
Your Majesty, how can you smile?

347
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,390
Lady Feng Yin is being carried away.

348
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,790
He is the True God.

349
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,870
What can I do about it?

350
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:16,500
Let's stay out of the young people's
business.

351
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,220
Let me down!

352
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,500
Yuan Qi.

353
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,630
What are you trying to do?

354
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:37,020
This is a piece of Feng Ming's
immortal spirit. It stores

355
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,740
(Lustrous Moon)
his last memory before he died.

356
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,160
Just give me a few days
to complete the formation.

357
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,590
Then we'll get a clue to the murderer.

358
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,030
You wouldn't have to marry Hong Yi,
would you?

359
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:51,260
You have your way. I have my plans.

360
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,780
You don't really believe that
I'm marrying Hong Yi

361
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,630
just to find the devil cultivator,
do you?

362
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:58,030
Do you have other plans?

363
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,830
It's not something you should worry about.

364
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,660
- Then I...
- Stop it.

365
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,760
Yuan Qi? What are you doing here?

366
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,190
You're marrying Feng Yin tomorrow.

367
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,950
Why don't you have a drink with me?

368
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,390
Do we know each other well?

369
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,550
You're drunk on love.

370
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,030
Do you think it's a good idea to come
to me, the groom?

371
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,760
Hong Yi,

372
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:57,660
we've been through thick and thin
together, haven't we?

373
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,790
Feng Yin has chosen you.

374
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,150
I've decided to give up.

375
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:10,420
But the good thing is
I'm sure you'll be good to her.

376
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,700
Absolutely.

377
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:19,540
But if you dare to
put her through any harm,

378
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,340
I'm definitely coming for you.

379
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,980
You're such a nosy True God.

380
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:33,220
Don't worry.
I won't give you this chance.

381
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,220
Great.

382
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:36,980
Drink.

383
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,900
Hong Yi.

384
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,100
How long has it been
since we've had a drink together?

385
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,420
It's so melodramatic.

386
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,660
I insisted on performing the Heavenly
Thunder punishment on you back then.

387
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,740
It almost killed you.

388
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,860
I regret it.

389
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:05,380
I've been trying to find a chance to
come here and apologize to you.

390
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,900
But so much has happened since then.

391
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,540
I haven't been able
to apologize to you in person.

392
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,060
So you've come to apologize to me?

393
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,180
Sort of.

394
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,060
At least the apology is genuine.

395
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,500
That's true.

396
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,740
I can tell if you're sincere or not.

397
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,060
My good friend.

398
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,140
Yuan Qi,

399
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,500
you don't have to apologize to me.

400
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:09,900
Instead, I'm the one who should
apologize.

401
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,220
There are many excuses.

402
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,940
But no matter what,

403
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:19,980
I'm responsible for the massacre
of Daze Mountain.

404
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,180
I'm in debt to the whole sect,

405
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:27,780
especially Xian Shan and Xian Zhu.

406
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,700
Why are you getting soberer?

407
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,460
It's getting late.

408
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,900
I should go back.

409
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:55,140
Hope everything goes well
at your wedding tomorrow.

410
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,820
Have you known everything?

411
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,140
You don't have to hide it from me.

412
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,340
Feng Yin told me the plan.

413
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,420
It's easy to get the god light.

414
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,060
But I'm not sure if the other plan can

415
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,540
come to fruition.

416
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,460
Don't worry.

417
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:16,060
Parasol is originally from
the God Realm.

418
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:20,380
Fuchen can grow into a parasol tree.
When the tree absorbs the god light,

419
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:28,420
it can use the God Realm's tracking
technique to find Purple Moon.

420
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,940
You don't have to worry about it.

421
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:43,980
Sleep well.

422
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,100
You also came.

423
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:06,840
It's been a long time.

424
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,300
Yeah.

425
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,140
Elder Mu Ling.

426
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,900
He has been missing for days.

427
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,620
Why is he here all of a sudden?

428
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,140
There's devil energy left in him.
Something's wrong here.

429
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,580
Elder Bei Cang?

430
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:23,660
We're in a spell formation.
The spiritual power is useless here.

431
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,260
Get out of here!

432
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:40,820
Your Highness!

433
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,340
Father.

434
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,380
The wedding is about to begin.
Do you know what they're planning?

435
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:10,100
The guards in ambush near Eagle Island
have just sent back news.

436
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:13,420
Yan Shuang has fallen into the trap.
We're one step away.

437
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,900
But the other sects have already left.

438
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,500
If we're late for too long,

439
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,780
the Peacock Clan will be criticized.

440
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:24,540
Why don't I go ahead
and give you some cover?

441
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,460
Let me know when you've found out
their intentions.

442
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,620
I'll improvise.

443
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,700
That's the only way now.

444
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,900
Greetings, Your Majesty.

445
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,620
Don't be over-courteous.

446
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:00,380
It's a happy day for Wutong Island,
so make yourselves at home.

447
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,260
- Greetings, Your Majesty!
- Greetings, Your Majesty!

448
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,980
The time has come to welcome
the Phoenix Queen.

449
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,340
Greetings, Phoenix Queen.

450
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,420
Rise.

451
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,440
(Where's Hong Yi?)

452
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,660
Your Majesty.

453
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,420
Wake up, Your Majesty.

454
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,340
It's going to be late
for the auspicious time.

455
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,860
Why are you all here?

456
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,940
Your Majesty, you've finally woken up.

457
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,580
It's 9:45 and we're going to be late
for the wedding ceremony.

458
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,020
9:45?

459
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,820
Why didn't you wake me up earlier?

460
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,260
Why hasn't the Demon King
arrived yet?

461
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,660
Where's the groom at this hour?

462
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,700
What kind of man would be late
for his wedding?

463
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,180
This Demon King is so cocky.

464
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,820
I've heard that this marriage
is an exchange of favors.

465
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,700
Judging from the Demon King's attitude,

466
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,620
it's true he doesn't want to marry her.

467
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,220
Che, don't talk nonsense.

468
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,420
This is nonsense!

469
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,180
The Demon King is too disrespectful.

470
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,020
Right.

471
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,260
It's not polite.

472
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,900
We've waited for so long.

473
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,340
Yuan Qi, you gave me the strongest wine.

474
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,740
You'll be dead by the time
the wedding is over.

475
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:02,860
Devil?

476
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,020
Your Majesty.

477
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:19,020
Your Majesty, please save
Princess Yan Shuang.

478
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:20,940
What's happened to her?

479
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:23,220
We were drawn to a trap by the devil
on our way to your wedding

480
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,340
with the Phoenix Queen.
The casualties are heavy.

481
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,620
Her Highness...

482
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,460
Where is she?

483
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,780
Right over there.

484
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,100
Your Majesty.

485
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,660
His Majesty must have been drunk
and missed the auspicious time.

486
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,460
I don't know where he's been
since he sobered up.

487
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,940
(Yan Shuang is also absent.)

488
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,700
(What happened?)

489
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,380
Is the Demon King trying to
break up the wedding?

490
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:54,060
I can't believe the Phoenix Queen is
abandoned by her groom on her wedding day.

491
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,460
It's a disgrace.

492
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,740
If the Demon King doesn't want
to marry her,

493
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,340
why did he agree to this marriage
in the first place?

494
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,820
Because I'm the one who didn't want
him to come.

495
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,820
Greetings, Your Godship.

496
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,220
All rise.

497
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,780
I made the Demon King drunk.

498
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,620
I'm afraid he won't be able to make it
to the wedding.

499
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,580
We were wrong about him.

500
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:44,700
Hong Yi told me about your second plan
when he was drunk.

501
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,940
You want to use the parasol tree to absorb
god light to find Purple Moon.

502
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,460
I can help you, too.

503
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,180
We've had at least one experience
with marriage.

504
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:56,380
It's a fake wedding anyway.
Am I not better than Hong Yi?

505
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:02,780
You're better than anyone
at being a scoundrel.

506
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,540
Your Godship, the Demon King is drunk
and late for the wedding.

507
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,980
He has no regard for the Immortal Realm.

508
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,500
We can't let the Phoenix Queen
suffer this insult.

509
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:15,620
I think we should call it quits.

510
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,980
You don't have to excuse
the Demon King anymore.

511
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,660
The engagement is naturally off the table.

512
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,940
Otherwise, I'll have robbed the bride
today for nothing.

513
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,860
Rob the bride?

514
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,820
Rob?

515
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,740
Rob? That's something.

516
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,740
He wants to rob the bride.

517
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,020
What's going on?

518
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,460
Since you're all here,

519
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:41,420
listen up, it's not that the Demon King
doesn't want to come.

520
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,620
I went to great lengths to get him drunk.

521
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,700
He can't come.

522
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,020
I've been in love with the Phoenix Queen
for a long time.

523
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,060
I didn't expect the Demon King
to get the upper hand.

524
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,300
So I had to do this.

525
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,390
♪Witness several rounds of

00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:32,130
